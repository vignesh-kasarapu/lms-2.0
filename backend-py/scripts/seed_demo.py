"""Demo-org seed — port of backend/src/utils/seedDemo.js. Run AFTER scripts.seed and
scripts.seed_employees:

    python -m scripts.seed_demo

Fills every screen with data: departments, management levels, reporting lines, MANAGER/HR_ADMIN
grants, project + standing watcher + working pattern, holidays, 14 leave requests covering every
request state, and 3 delegations (primary / supervisor-initiated / fallback). Requests and
delegations go through the real service layer (ledger postings, routing, watchers, notifications
all execute) — nothing is hand-inserted except the two timestamp back-dates the Node script also
does. Idempotent: each scenario is skipped when its own marker already exists.
