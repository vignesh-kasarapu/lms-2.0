"""Mirrors backend/src/services/bulkImport.service.js (LMS-019).

KNOWN LIMITATION vs. Node: Node wraps the whole import in one DB transaction,
so a circular-hierarchy failure partway through the manager-wiring pass rolls
back every employee created in the same batch. Several DAOs this service
depends on (employee_dao.create, role_dao.create_grant via
role_assignment_service, scheduled_job_run_dao.create via
accrual_service.post_opening_pro_rata) commit eagerly rather than only
flushing, so a failure on the LAST row's manager-wiring will NOT undo the
employee rows already committed for earlier rows in this same call. The
per-row validation pass below (which is read-only and runs to completion
before anything is created) is what actually prevents most bad imports;
only a circular-hierarchy failure discovered during the second pass can
leave a partial import committed. Flagged here rather than silently
pretending this port has the same atomicity guarantee as Node."""
