"""Mirrors backend/src/utils/mailer.js — basic-auth SMTP (Gmail app password),
configured via MAIL_HOST/MAIL_PORT/MAIL_USERNAME/MAIL_PASSWORD. The from
address is always the authenticated mailbox. Synchronous (the whole app is
sync SQLAlchemy) rather than Node's fire-and-forget async — callers already
send email after the DB commit, outside the request's own transaction, so a
slow/failing send still can't roll back the business action; it just adds
latency to the response instead of happening truly in the background."""
